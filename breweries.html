                            <p>The tap room and nano-brewery is very much the heart-beat of Frontier. It is our home. 
                                Everything we have ever produced has evolved here. Our tap room is open every Friday from 14:00 onwards. 
                                Here you will find something different on tap every week, and several specialities in bottle or can too. 
                                We pump some eclectic music, serve boerie rolls with some tasty relishes, and generally sign off the week with a bang!

                        <address>222 Dykor Street Silverton Pretoria 0184 South Africa </address>
                        <p>Drayman’s Highveld Single Malt Whisky is the first ever Single Malt from the Highveld of South Africa. 
                            This potstill whisky is mashed, fermented, distilled and matured in a craft distillery in Silverton, Pretoria – 1600m above sea level. 
                            French Oak casks are exclusively used for the maturation. 
                            This rare combination of the casks and the high altitude have combined with the skill of the master distiller to yield a malt of 
                            exceptional complexity. Drayman’s Single Malt Whisky is made in the same way as its Scottish inspiration, albeit on a craft scale.
