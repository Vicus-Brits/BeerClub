                    <h3>Different Types of Beer</h3>
                    <p>All beers are either lagers or ales, and that's determined by the type of yeast used during the fermentation process. 
                        Lagers are made with yeast that ferments at the bottom of the beer mixture, and ales are made with yeast that ferments at the top. 
                        There are also spontaneously fermenting yeasts, which make wild or sour ales..<a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/27/different-types-of-beers.html">

                    <h3>Five reasons that craft beer is better</h3>
                    <p>The average alcohol by volume (ABV) content of a craft beer is 5% to 10%, but some of the most popular craft beers have an 
                        ABV as high as 40%! In contrast, beer produced in bulk by giant corporations who don’t put a little bit of love in 
                        each bottle give you a drink that has an ABV of 4% to 6%, and as little as 2%. <a href="http://deadpresidentspub.com/five-reasons-craft-beer-better/">
