<h1>Vicus Brits: Large Coursework</h1>
<br>
<h3>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement? </h3>
<br>
<h4>Site Map</h4>
<img src="report/sitemap.png" alt="sitemap">
<p>The website is for a group of individuals which go off one Saturday a month to visit a different local craft brewery to learn about, drink and stock up on beer.</p>
<p>[1] <a href="beers.html">Beers.html</a> is a fun page where you can look at different ones, 
    decide which one you like and when you click on it, it takes you to <a href="breweries.html">Breweries.html</a> for the brewers details.</p>
<p>[2] There is also a 'hidden' <a href="member.html">Member.html</a> page which you can access by [signing up] or [logging in] on the <a href="join.html">join.html. </a></p>
<p>Once on the member page you can vote for the next brewery to visit and view the results of the voting so far. </p>
<p>Logging out of the member page removes the Member Area from the navigation header. </p>
<p>Both joining and logging functionality is enabled with Javascript (the access is hardcoded and not secure but was fun enough to code :)). </p>
<p>The <a href="learn.html">Articles.html</a> page has links to external articles to learn more. Javascript DOM manipulation hides/shows articles based on the user’s interest. </p>
<p>The <a href="index.html">Index.html</a> page calls an external API for some comic relief. </p>

<h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</h3>
<p>Being new to web development I found all of this rather intimidating, so, inspritation came from everything that did not look intimidating</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The W3Schools tutorials have a way of breaking things down to it's simplist level</p>
        <p>This inspired me to keep my code simple (in line with my skill level) and is the reason why I have not yet tried bootstrap and Handlebars</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>There are lost of great tutorals out there, but they are often hard to understand past copy and paste.</p>
        <p> I found the 2 pieces of code (Code used [4] and [5] below) specifically inspiring in that I could understand and replicate what was done</p>      
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I find most inspiring what I can do with this newfound skill</p>
        <p>As a day job I manage projects, which build 'back end services'</p>
        <p>I am now able significantly enhance our testing capability by building a website which mimics the consuming system</p>
    </li>

</ul>
<br>



<h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible. </h3>
<p>The site is geared towards accessibility for the vissualy impaired. </p>
<ul>
    <li>All Images have alt tags. </li>
    <li>Where images are loaded as background images via css, aria-label's provide navigation. </li>
    <li>The top header navigation has explanotory title tags. </li>
    <li>High Contrast colour selection assists with readability. </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site. </h3>
<p>The website is design to be fun and easy to interact with. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Website is designed 'Mobile-First' accomodating for more users accessing the web via mobile devices. </li>
    <li>Images are shrunk down to a minimum to facilitate faster loading times. </li>
    <li>The selection of beers is a fun way to select which brewery to visit next. </li>
    <li>Provision is made for users with disability. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, 
    and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, 
    any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site). </h3>
<p>As I had to learn HTML/CSS/JS from scratch, it is tough to pick only three things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Javascript is top of the list. I watched countless videos to figure out how it works and what you can do with it. </p>
        <p>I spent way too much time googling server side Javascript ( the idea is cool ) and Javascript games ( even cooler ).</p>
        <p>I got the idea of a Javascript login from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAu7cMuu0BI">YouTube</a> and then proceeded to build out futher functionality from there. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>CSS is my weak spot and I will be studying it in more detail over the next few weeks. </p>
        <p>I did not use boostrap as I did not want to implement any code, I did not understand. </p>
        <p> I found a nice tutorial on <a href="https://xopixel.com/responsive-animated-image-grid-html5-css3/">xopixel.com</a> which I used to create <a href="beers.html">Beers.html</a>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>For me to apply my webskills at work I have a requirement to be able to make a SOAP XML call. </p>
        <p>To get started I found how to make a JSON API call on <a href="http://zetcode.com/javascript/jsonurl/"> zetcode.com</a>. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? </h3>
<p>Planning and execution went reasonably well. </p>
<p>I treated the work as a formal project and used github not only to check my code in, but also to log tasks and issues.  </p>
<p>Estimation of effort is hard when you do not have the actual techinical skills yet. Estimating the learning curve is also tricky, 
    having a structured issues list helped me keep to the timeline (in the end it was also used to decide which functionalty to descope.) </p>

<br>
<h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time? </h3>
<p>Javascript is the area I would most like to improve on. Before this course I knew a lot of SQL and a bit of Python. </p>
<p>I can see how a combination of HTML/CSS/JS/Python/SQL will enable me to build cool stuff. </p>
<p>The section that could/should be the most improved is CSS. </p>
<p>I experimented with different CSS styles, using Float, Grid and Flex. </p>
<p>I should perhaps have picked one and really learnt it well. </p>
<p>If I had to do it again, I would probaly stick to Grid layout (a prior version used for wireframes) and use flex only for menus. </p>
<p>Having said that, I may not have full control ovber the CSS yet, but rebuilding the stylesheet mutiple times made me more confident. </p>
<p>In the next couple of weeks I will make a detailed study of Flex and Grid to solidify what I have learnt. </p>

<h3>Appendices: Site Map, Wireframes and Mockups</h3>

<br>
<h4>Wireframes</h4>
<p>I used HTML and CSS to do the initial wireframes. There are many better ways to do this, but I chose the 'coding' route as I needed the learning and practice</p>
<p>The result was close the original wireframes, with the following main exceptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The carousel on the home page was removed and replaced with an external API call presenting jokes. </li>
    <li>On the beers page, the design got overly complex once I added images and decised on a simpler solution</li>
    <li>On the join page significant functionality was added
        <ul>
            <li>Simple Log In functionality was added</li>
            <li>Log Out functionality was added</li>
            <li>A member area was added, (only visible when logged in) </li>
            <li>In the member area a survey monkey survey was added</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
