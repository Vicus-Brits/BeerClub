<h1>Vicus Brits: Large Coursework</h1>
<br>
<h3>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Site Map</h4>
<img src="report/sitemap.png" alt="sitemap">
<p>The website is for a group of individuals which go off one Saturday a month to visit a different local craft brewery to learn about, drink and stock up on beer.</p>
<p>[1] <a href="beers.html">Beers.html</a> is a fun page where you can look at different ones, decide which one you like and when you click on it, it takes you to <a href="breweries.html">Breweries.html</a> for the brewers details</p>
<p>[2] There is also a 'hidden' <a href="member.html">Member.html</a> page which you can access by [signing up] or [logging in] on the <a href="join.html">join.html</a></p>
<p>Once on the member page you can vote for the next brewery to visit and view the results of the voting so far</p>
<p>Logging out of the member page removes the Member Area from the navigation header</p>
<p>Both joining and logging functionality is enabled with Javascript ( the access is hardcoded and not secure but was fun enough to code :) ) </p>
<p>The <a href="learn.html">Articles.html</a> page has links to external articles to learn more. Javascript DOM manipulation hides/shows articles based on the users interest</p>
<p>The <a href="index.html">Index.html</a> page calls an external API for some comic relief</p>

<h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</h3>
<br>

<h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
<p>The site is geared towards accessibility for the vissualy impaired</p>
<ul>
    <li>All Images have alt tags</li>
    <li>Where images are loaded as background images via css, aria-label's provide navigation</li>
    <li>The top header navigation has explanotory title tags</li>
    <li>High Contrast colour selection assists with readability </li>
</ul>
<br>


<h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h3>
<p>The website is design to be fun and easy to interact with</p>
<ul>
    <li>Website is designed 'Mobile-First' accomodating for more users accessing the web via mobile devices</li>
    <li>Images are shrunk down to a minimum to facilitate faster loading times</li>
    <li>The selection of beers is a fun way to select which brewery to visit next</li>
    <li>Provision is made for users with disability</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, 
    and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, 
    any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</h3>
<p>As I had to learn HTML/CSS/JS from scratch, it is tough to pick only three things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Javascript is top of the list. I watched countless videos to figure out how it works and what you can do with it.</p>
        <p>I spent way too much time googling server side Javascript ( the idea is cool ) and Javascript games ( even cooler ).</p>
        <p>I got the idea of a Javascript login from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAu7cMuu0BI">YouTube</a> and then proceeded to build out futher functionality from there.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>CSS is my weak spot and I will be studying it in more detail over the next few weeks</p>
        <p>I did not use boostrap as I did not want to implement any code I did not understand</p>
        <p> I found a nice tutorial on <a href="https://xopixel.com/responsive-animated-image-grid-html5-css3/">xopixel.com</a> which I used to create <a href="beers.html">Beers.html</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>For me to apply my webskills at work I have a requirement to be able to make a SOAP XML call</p>
        <p>To get started I found how to make a JSON API call on <a href="http://zetcode.com/javascript/jsonurl/"> zetcode.com</a>. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
<p>Planning and execution went reasonably well.</p>
<p>I treated the work as a formal project and used github not only to check my code in, but also to log tasks and issues </p>
<p>Estimation of effort is hard when you do not have the actual techinical skills yet. Estimating the learning curve is also tricky, 
    having a structured issues list helped me keep to the timeline (in the end it was also used to decide which functionalty to descope.)</p>

<br>
<h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h3>
<p>Javascript is the area I would most like to improve on. Before this course I knew a lot of SQL and a bit of Python.</p>
<p>I can see how a combination of HTML/CSS/JS/Python/SQL will enable me to build cool stuff.</p>
<p>The section that could/should be the most improved is CSS.</p>
<p>I experimented with different CSS styles, using Float, Grid and Flex.</p>
<p>I should have picked one and really learnt it well.</p>
<p>If I had to do it again, I would probaly stick to Grid layout (a prior version) and used flex only for menus.</p>
<p>Having said that, I may not have full control ovber the CSS yet, but rebuilding the stylesheet mutiple times made me more confident.</p>
<p>In the next couple of weeks I will make a detailed study of Flex and Grid to solidify what I have learnt.</p>

<h3>What resources were used when creating your work?</h3> 
<p><em>You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. 
    You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</em></p>

<p>Taking things from the web</p>
<p>You can use almost anything you like that you can find on the Web, but you should avoid</p>
<p>anything that is not open (e.g. that costs money or requires login or registration), or</p>
<p>anything from sites belonging to commercial companies. Being able to re-use other people's</p>
<p>ideas is an important web skill. However, it is essential that, on your report page, you</p>
<p>describe what you have taken, where you took it from, and what you have done to it. If you</p>
<p>copy-and-paste something almost without change, you must say that you have done it, it</p>
<p>must conform to the standards, and you shouldn't expect many marks for it, except for how</p>
<p>you have made it fit in with and enhance your own design. To get more marks you can use</p>
<p>code from elsewhere, document the source of the code in your report.html and then edit it</p>
<p>in some way. Showing you can adapt existing code will earn you more marks. In order to be</p>
<p>clear which material you have written and which you have used from elsewhere you will be</p>
<p>expected to provide comprehensive comments within your HTML, CSS and Javascript files</p>
<p>indicating code you have used, code you have adopted and edited and code that you have</p>
<p>written.</p>
