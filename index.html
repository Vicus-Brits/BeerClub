                <h2>About the club</h2>
                <p>Beer Club has its origins in the 2020 COVID 19 Pandemic, 
                    a dark time in South-Africa's history where the population could not go out to have a beer and worse.. was also prohibted from buying beer.</p>
                <p> Couple that calamatity with one of the founding members needing to build a club website for academic purposes and you have the birth of Beer Club.</p>
                <p> Beer Club is about celebrating drinking and brewing beer for <em>'academic purposes'</em>..</p>
                    <br>
                <h2>What we do</h2>
                <p> Beer Club meets every second Saturday of the month to visit one of the craft breweries nearby (nearby Centurion, South Africa that is) 
                    where we soak up the vibe,(and the beer), and perhaps buy some stock for the month.</p>
                <p> The main purpose of this website is to drive the selection of which brewery to visit next.</p>
                <p> Next year we plan to start home brewing </p>
                <br>
                <p> You can sharpen up on your knowledge of beer and beer brewing on our <a href="learn.html">Articles page </a></p>
                <br> 
                <p> Selection of the next brewery to visit is done by looking for some beer-bottle-inspiration on the <a href="beers.html"> beers page</a> or by direct brewery selection on the<a href="breweries.html"> breweries page</a></p>
                <p> In order to vote, you need to <a href="join.html">log in first</a> </p>
                <p> Security on the website is not very tight ( dont use you banking password ), but logging in will take you to our survey.</p>
                <p> New members are immediately taken to the survey page.</p>
                <p> If you live nearby, and like to talk beer and I.T. please join us for relaxed saturday afternoon</p>
